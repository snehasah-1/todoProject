# React Todo App with Vite

This is a simple todo application built using React and Vite and Redux

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Install Vite</h4>
To get started, you'll need to install Vite globally using npm:

    npm install -g vite

<h4>Step 2: Create a New Vite Project</h4>
Once Vite is installed, you can create a new Vite project for your todo app. Run the following command and follow the prompts:

    npm init vite

<p>During project initialization, you'll be asked to provide a project name and a package name. For example:<p>

<li>Project Name: todo-app</li>
<li>Package Name: todo-app</li>

<p>You'll also need to select React as the framework and choose the variant that suits your preference:</p>

<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Typescript</li>
<li>Javascript + swc</li>
<li>Typescript + swc</li>

<h4>Step 3: Run Your Project</h4>
After your project is created, navigate to the project directory:

    cd todo-app

Install the project dependencies:

    npm install

Start the development server:

    npm run dev

This command will start a development server, and you can begin building your React todo application right away.
